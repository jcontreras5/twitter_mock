# Tweeter: A Twitter Clone

## Purpose

This lightweight and minimalist Twitter clone distills the popular social media app down to its essence. The homepage displays only all the posts created by users along with author names and date/time stamps. An "explore" route permits a user to see a directory of all users of the site, and dynamic scripting makes the site navigation responsive to a user's current status.

## Technologies

This Python project is on a Flask framework with database support via Psycopg2, SQLAlchemy and Postgres. Flask-WTF handles and secures user input, and Flask Werkzeug encrypts passwords. The Datetime library is used to create timestamps for all tweets and to reformat date/time information on the homepage. Flask Flash messages update users about authorization and form submission events. Jinja2 templates support a dynamic nav and efficient site design, while Bootstrap columns, rows, and cards keep the flow of information streamlined and tidy.
